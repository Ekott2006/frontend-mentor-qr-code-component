## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Using  `place-items` to center element both horizontally and vertically

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- Placing the Footer

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me for master CSS Grid very easily. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
